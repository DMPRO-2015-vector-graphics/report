\section{Improvements}
The final implementation of the processor, is a multi-cycle mips inspired processor.
In this design one instruction is executed each for second or third cycle.
To increase the number of instructions per cycle, the processor could have been pipelined.
But given the time constraint, the group never found the time to implement a pipelined processor.
