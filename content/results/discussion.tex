\section{Design Errors}
During the initial planning the group read previous computer project reports,
and the report from the Demolicious gave the group valuable suggestions \cite{demolicious-report}.
Demolicious stated that most of the component had header pins in case something went wrong.
When designing a lot of redundancy was placed on the board.
After soldering the board the group discovered multiple design issues. TODO: which design issues

\section{Architecture Design}
Before any actual coding and soldering the group spent time planning the architecture.
TODO: Vi burde hatt floating point for å gjøre vektorutregninger.
