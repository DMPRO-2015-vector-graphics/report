\section{Oscillator}
To acheive a high clock frequency on the \gls{fpga}, a 100 MHz oscillator was added to the board.
Using it as the main clock signal, the \gls{fpga} was not able to produce correct output.
An oscilloscope was used to measure the oscillator output on a header.
If a hand was placed in close proximity of the board, the oscillator signal was significantly affected.
This problem was solved by using the 48 MHz oscillator instead.
