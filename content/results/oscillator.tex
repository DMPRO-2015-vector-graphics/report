\section{Oscillator}
To acheive a high clock frequency on the \gls{fpga} a 100 MHz oscillator was added to the board.
However each time the 100 MHz oscillator was used as the main clock signal,
the \gls{fpga} was not able to produce correct output.
An oscilloscope was used to measure the oscillator output on a header.
If a hand was placed in close proximity of the board the oscillator signal was significantly affected.
The measured signal was also too low peak to peak, for the \gls{fpga} to be used as a clock signal.
Placing the 100 MHz oscillator closer to the \gls{fpga} would most likely have removed it's sensitivity to noise.
