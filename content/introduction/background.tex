\chapter{Background and Theory}
\label{chp:background}

Vector graphics have been popular in the computer industry for many years,
seeing frequent use in analogue oscilloscopes, video arcade games \cite{astroids},
and as display devices for computers \cite{ibm2250}\cite{tektronix4010}.
This chapter introduces the concept of vector graphics, and compares it to it's counterpart, the raster graphic.

\section{Computer Graphics}
Computer graphics, introduced around 1960\cite[sec. 1.1.1]{graphics-visualization-algorithms}, is the huge branch in today's computing world that deals with imagery and animations produced by a computer.
At it's core, this project deals with the type of computer graphics defined as vector graphics, which is detailed further in this section.
As the project involves what is known as raster graphics, the report includes raster graphic theory as well.

\section{Display Technology}
In the early days of computer display, vector displays were mainly used.
The use of frame buffers started when transistor-based RAM was introduced.
As a result, raster graphics and displays were created. \cite[sec. 1.1]{graphics-visualization-algorithms}.

Today, there exists a vast variety of display technologies - a few examples are CRT, LCD, LED and OLED.
This section discusses vector displays and raster displays, and follows with a comparison between the two. It ends with an introduction to an oscilloscope, which was used in the project to output the vector graphics.

\section{FPGA}
A field programmable gate array (FPGA) was to be used to execute the graphics processor.
The FPGA - an integrated circuit - is a powerful tool, in that it can be altered to support a wide array of use cases.
While a normal processor is application specific and configured during manufacturing, an FPGA includes programmable logic that can be configured almost any way you want it\cite{fpga}.
Hardware definition languages (HDL), e.g. VHDL and Verilog, are used to program the FPGA.
FPGAs provide both advantages and disadvantages compared to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC).
Most noteworthy is the simpler design cycles and a predictable project cycle, compared to the decreased customizability and higher unit costs for high volume productions\cite{fpgavsasic}.
