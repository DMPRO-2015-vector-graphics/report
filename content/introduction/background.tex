\chapter{Background and Theory}

Vector graphics have been popular in the computer industry for many years,
seeing frequent use in analogue oscilloscopes, video arcade games \cite{astroids},
and as display devices for computers \cite{ibm2250}.

\section{Computer Graphics}
There are two different types of representing computer graphics today, vector graphics and raster graphics.

\section{Visual Display}
In the early days of computer display, vector displays were mainly used.
The use of frame buffers started when transistor-based RAM was introduced.
As a result raster graphics and displays were created \cite{graphics-visualization-algorithms}.
There exists vast variety of display technologies, a few examples are: CRT, LCD, LED and OLED.
Without going into detail about each technology,
a few of the basic principles will be described in the following subsections.
