\chapter{Background and Theory}

Vector graphics have been popular in the computer industry for many years, seeing frequent use in analogue oscilloscopes, video arcade games \cite{astroids}, and as display devices for computers \cite{ibm2250}.

\section{Vector graphics}

With vector graphics, mathematical expressions are used to describe an image.
The image, or the scene, is made up of primitives that describe paths and curves in order to create more complex shapes.

Vector graphics are predominantly used in 2D graphics, and is called vector graphics in order to distinguish from 2D raster graphics. In 3D graphics the internal representation of the world is usually described with vector primitives (points that form triangle surfaces for example). TODO: Some citation.

Some computer font types, like TrueType uses vector graphics and more specifically BÃ©zier curves to represent glyphs\cite{truetype}.


TODO: Make coherent.
