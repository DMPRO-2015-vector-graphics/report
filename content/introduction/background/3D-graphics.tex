\subsection{3D Graphics}
//TODO: Is this section needed?
Vector graphics are predominantly used to describe 2D graphics, in order to distinguish them from 2D raster graphics. 
In 3D graphics, most implementations utilize points, lines and curves to define shapes, which makes them a lot like vector graphics. 
Voxel graphics is an implementation of 3D graphics that tries to define it's shapes by utilizing three dimensional pixels, so-called 'voxels', but is rarely used.
