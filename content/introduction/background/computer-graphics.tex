\section{Computer Graphics}
There are two different types of representing computer graphics today, vector graphics and raster graphics.


\subsection{Vector Graphics}
With vector graphics, mathematical expressions are used to describe an image.
The image, or the scene, is made up of primitives that describe paths and curves in order to create more complex shapes.

Vector graphics are predominantly used in 2D graphics, and is called vector graphics in order to distinguish from 2D raster graphics.
In 3D graphics the internal representation of the world is usually described with vector primitives (points that form triangle surfaces for example).

Some computer font types, like TrueType uses vector graphics and more specifically BÃ©zier curves to represent glyphs\cite{truetype}.

\subsection{Raster Graphics}
