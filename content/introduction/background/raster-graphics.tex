\subsection{Raster Graphics}
Raster graphics is also known as bitmap graphics.
A raster image is a two-dimensional array of descrete values.
Each descrete value is used to describe the color of the pixel at a given position in the array.
A bitmap images is often represented by utilizing the RGB scheme.
RGB is a scheme where you define the amount of red, green and blue color of a pixel.

To display a full image, the computer needs to store \( (width \times height) \times RGB \) bits.
Today RBG usally contains 3 bytes, one byte for each color,
and a resolution of \(1920 \times 1080\) is becomming the standard.
A single image therefore requires about 6.2 MB to store.
There exists method to compress images, however raster images still uses a significant amount of space.
