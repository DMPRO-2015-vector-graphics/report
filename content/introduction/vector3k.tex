The end result of the group's work on this project, is a computer architecture made with the processing and production of vector graphics in mind.
Said architecture is named V.E.C.T.O.R -3000, an acronym for Very Efficient Computer for Transferring graphics to Oscilloscope and Raster screens, with the -3000 added as an homage to the retrofuturistic associations of vector graphics in popular culture.

V.E.C.T.O.R. -3000 is a general purpose vector graphics processor, capable of // INSERT MERITS AND FUNCTIONALITY HERE
