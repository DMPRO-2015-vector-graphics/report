\begin{abstract}

\vthreek is a general purpose, vector graphics processor. 
The processor is implemented on a Xilinx \gls{fpga} and the system as a whole realised on a custom made PCB.
Support for integer arithmetic, data movement, conditional execution and reading/writing from/to a data memory is implemented.
\vthreek also has special purpose instructions for working with vector graphics as well as a separate memory representing a scene.
The system produces an analogue two-coordinate output that can be shown on any display supporting X,Y input.
\vthreek is realized on a \gls{pcb}, and was verified using both software simulations and physical testing.

A demo program was written for \vthreek in its custom made \gls{isa}.
This program executed correctly and showed vector output on an analogue oscilloscope with a vector display.
The system is still in the prototype stage, but meets most of its requirements, especially those relating to the processing and display of vector graphics.
