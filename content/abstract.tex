\begin{abstract}

\vthreek is a general purpose vector processor. 
The system utilizes a Xilinx FPGA as the main processing unit, that produces and processes vector graphics.
In addition to handling everything a regular processor does, \vthreek has specialised vector instructions and memory.
The system produces an analogue two-coordinate output that can be shown on a vector display, e.g. an oscilloscope. 
\vthreek is realized on a \gls{pcb}, and was verified using both software simulations and physical testing.

A demo program was written for \vthreek in a custom made \gls{isa}.
This program executed correctly and showed vector output on an oscilloscope.
The system is still in the prototype stage, but meets most of its requirements, especially those relating to the processing and display of vector graphics.
