\vthreek is a general purpose vector processor. 
The system utilizes a Xilinx FPGA as the main processing unit, that produces and processes vector graphics.
In addition to handling everything a regular processor does, \vthreek has specialised vector instructions and memory as well.
The system also has an analogue two-coordinate output that can be shown on a vector display, e.g. an oscilloscope. 

A demo program was written for \vthreek that executed correctly and showed output on the oscilloscope.
The system is still in the prototype stage, but meets most of its requirements, especially those relating to the processing and display of vector graphics.
