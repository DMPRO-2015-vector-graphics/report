Figure \ref{fig:system-overview} shows how the major building blocks of the \vthreek architecture come together on a conceptual level.
Separation of instruction and data memory makes it a Harvard-like architecture.
The processor reads from instruction memory, executes instructions and adds/updates vector primitives in the scene memory.
Preprocessing these primitives for output is done by the output modules.
For the HDMI output, this involves rasterizing each primitive and maintaining a framebuffer.
The oscilloscope output is generated by serializing primitives onto two DACs.
