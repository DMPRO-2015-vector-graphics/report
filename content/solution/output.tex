\section{Raster output}

This output uses HDMI to output a rasterized image of the internal vector representation.

\section{DAC output}

The primary output of the processor is the analogue one.
Two DACs are driven from the FPGA over a serial interface.
The DACs need a clock, data, and sync signal to operate. 
The clock and sync signal is shared between the DACs so they operate synchronously. 

// TODO: Better phrasing, three out of four sentences in a row starting with the.

The parallel to serial converter takes a 32-bit signal as input.
This signal represents the x,y-coordinate pair of a point that is to be drawn on the oscilloscope.
The converter splits the signal into its x and y components and clocks them out synchronously to their respective DACs.
