\chapter{Methodology}

As vector monitors are not easily available today, the group needed to find an alternative method of displaying vector graphics, preferrably without rasterization involved.
It was discussed to modify a CRT TV set to fit our output signal, but this was concluded to be quite cumbersome.
What was ultimately decided upon, was using a CRT oscilloscope. The team found an old oscilloscope - complete with a CRT display - stowed away in the lab, and decided to use this for the project.
