\chapter{Tools}

Many different tools were used in the process of designing and implementing \vthreek.
The following is a listing of some of the most prominent ones.

\begin{description}
    \item[Altium Designer] - \gls{pcb} design
    \item[Git] - Source code version control. A \href{https://github.com/DMPRO-2015-vector-graphics}{Github Organization} was created to gather repositories in a central location.
    \item[Google Drive] - Collaboration and sharing of text documents and spreadsheets.
    \item[Saleae Logical Analyzer] - Analyze signals between components and busses.
    \item[Simplicity Studio] - Development of software for and programming of the EFM32 microcontroller
    \item[Slack] For group communication.
    \item[Xilinx ISE (v.14.5)] - \gls{fpga} design/implementation toolchain
    \item[Xilinx ISim] - Simulation of \gls{fpga} designs in software.
    \item[Xilinx Impact] - For connecting to the FPGA over JTAG to program and debug.
