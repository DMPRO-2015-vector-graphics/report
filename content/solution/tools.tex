Many different tools were used in the process of designing and implementing \vthreek.
The following is a listing of some of the most prominent ones.
//TODO: Fill in all the tools used. Add JTAG flash stuff maybe also ARM debug

\begin{description}
    \item[Altium Designer] - PCB design
    \item[Google Drive] - Collaboration and sharing of text documents and spreadsheets.
    \item[Slack] For group communication.
    \item[Git] - Source code version control. A \href{https://github.com/DMPRO-2015-vector-graphics}{Github Organization} was created to gather repositories in a central location.
    \item[Simplicity Studio] - Development of software for and programming of the EFM32 microcontroller
    \item[Xilinx ISE (v.14.5)] - FPGA design/implementation toolchain
    \item[Xilinx ISim] - Simulation of FPGA designs in software.
