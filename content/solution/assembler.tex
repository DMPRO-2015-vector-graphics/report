\section{Assembler}
Initially the group wanted to create a compiler and have a higher level language.
Due to the time constraint only assembler were created.
As the group wanted specialized vector instruction, an unique instruction set were created.
The instruction set also contains more general instructions like branch and jump.
The assembler takes each instruction and converts it into 32 bit binary instruction words.
A complete ISA overview can be found in appendix \ref{app:isa}.
