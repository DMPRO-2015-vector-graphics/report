\section{Assembler}
Initially the group wanted to create a compiler and have a higher level language.
Due to the time constraint only assembler were created.
As the group wanted specialized vector instruction, an unique instruction set were created.
The instruction set also contains more general instructions like branch and jump.
The assembler takes each instruction and converts it into 32 bit binary instruction words.
The final implementation is written in Python and the source code is available at \cite{assembler}.
A complete ISA overview can be found in appendix \ref{app:isa}.
